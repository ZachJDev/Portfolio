Many years before I was interested in pursuing programming as a full-time job, I was enthralled by the procedural possibilities of Conway's Game of Life. There is something beautiful about the way such simple rules over many generations give way to such a wide variety of shapes and patterns. I was so happy the day I coded this, as it felt like one of my long-held goals had been achieved.

I focused more on practicing object-oriented programming than creating a rich feature set when I built this. Happily, a rich feature set is much easier to implement when the underlying code is well-structured, and I hope to add things like generational tracking and support for arbitrary rules in the near future.

This application was built with pure HTML and JS, leveraging the canvas API.
