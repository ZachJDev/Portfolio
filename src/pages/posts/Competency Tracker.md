This application aims to guide users as they develop an enterprise training curriculum by helping them break down the desired learning outcomes into competencies and skills, and then combine those into prototypical roles that employees may then fill. The project started as a work assignment, where I made something similar, though much smaller in scope, built on top of Excel. I began learning web development around the same time and began this project to put into practice what I had been learning. Since then, it has grown far past the original spec of the Excel application.

I wrote a post comparing [How I approached a UX decision](/blog/2020/02%20Feb/UX/2020-02-20%20Two-UX-Decisions/) I made for both the work assignment and this web-based application.

I built the backend of this application with Node.js, Express, and MongoDb. The frontend uses ejs templates.
